      <p strong> Virat Kohli is the captain of the Indian cricket team. He is also the finest batsman in world cricket, at the moment</p>
    <p strong> "junoon", "sukoon" and "zidd" are words from the Urdu language. "junoon" means passion, "sukoon" means contentment, and "zidd" is stubbornness. Together, these three words define Virat Kohli. He is stubborn in that he has the courage of conviction. He has supreme confidence and follows his instincts, in the toughest of times, and even when under severe pressure. His passion for the game, hunger for runs, and desire to improve every day, is second to none. His intensity notwithstanding, there is a sense of calm about his demeanour, as he displays great poise.</p>
    
    <p> As I chart my own path, Kohli's journey is an inspiration each day. I aspire for "junoon", "sukoon" and "zidd" in my own life, and hope to become a better person</p>

  <p>Following are some key highlights from Kohli's career thus far:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class = "bold">2002:</span> In October, 13-year-old Virat is called up to the Delhi Under-15 team for the Polly Umrigar Trophy. He finishes the season as Delhi’s top scorer.</li>
   <li><span class = "bold">2006:</span> After impressing at the youth level for Delhi, Virat is selected for the India Under-19 team for the first time and has a glorious tour of England, averaging over a hundred in the one-day series.</li>
    <li><span class = "bold">2008:</span> Virat captained India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, finishing the tournament as one of the top three run-getters. His natural leadership skills caught the attention of all the right people.</li>
    <li><span class = "bold">2008:</span> Virat was called up to the Indian ODI squad for the first time, playing all 5 matches in an away series against Sri Lanka. He scored his first half-century, an innings of 54, in game 4 of the series.</li>
    
    <li><span class = "bold">2009:</span> Virat had to wait a while to get back into the national team, but it was worth it when he scored his maiden ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111 deliveries at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.</li>
    
    <li><span class = "bold">2011:</span> Virat played every single match of India’s successful 2011 World Cup campaign, making his only century in the first game of the tournament against Bangladesh.</li>
    
    <li><span class = "bold">2011:</span> Virat finally got the chance to make his Test debut in 2011 against the West Indies, and unfortunately for the charismatic youngster, it was a far-from-memorable occasion, making a grand total of 19 runs in the two innings he played.</li>
    
    <li><span class = "bold">2012:</span> Kohli scored his first test hundred in rather spectacular circumstances in the fourth and final test against Australia at Adelaide.</li>

    
    <li><span class = "bold">2012:</span> Virat played what is arguably one of the best ODI innings ever by an Indian batsmen smashing 133 not out against Sri Lanka off just 86 balls to guide India to the final of CB Series in Australia.</li>
    
    <li><span class = "bold">2014:</span> Kohli got his first taste of Test captaincy when he was once again asked to step in for an injured MS in Australia, and celebrated by scoring a century in both innings in Adelaide.</li>
     
    <li><span class = "bold">2016:</span> His 82 off 51 balls was easily the best innings of his burgeoning career as India beat Australia in Mohali to advance to the semi-finals of the ICC World T20.</li>
    
    <li><span class = "bold">2017:</span> Kohli took limited overs captaincy from MS Dhoni in the beginning of the year and excelled at it.</li>
    
    <li><span class = "bold">2017:</span> He also overthrew AB de Villiers to score fastest 9000 ODI runs. He scored double centuries in 4 consecutive Test matches which is a record for any Indian captain.</li>
    </ul>
